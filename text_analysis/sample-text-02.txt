Once upon a time, two penguins played in the snow! They built a big snowman. The small penguin rolled a big snowball for the snowman base. The big penguin rolled two small snow balls for the snowman body and head. Then they gave the snowman eyes and a massive carrot nose! The carrot was bigger than any carrot the penguins had ever seen before! And last, the penguins gave a hat to the snowman. The small penguin stood on a chunk of ice to put the hat on the snowman's head. But the penguin slipped and dropped the hat! Right then, a seal snuck out from behind an ice chunk. The seal grabbed the hat! Oh no! The seal ran away! The penguins chased the seal up a massive iceberg. But the penguins couldn't catch the seal! The seal slipped back down the iceberg. So the penguins followed! The penguins wanted the snowman's hat! So the penguins slid faster than the seal. At the bottom of the iceberg, they caught him! "That's the snowman's hat, not yours!" So the penguins took back the hat and put it on the snowman's head. The end.
